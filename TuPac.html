                    <h1>Tupac Amaru Shakur</h1>
                    <h2> Born: June 16, 1971 </h2>
                    <h2> East Harlem, New York</h2>

                    <p> "Tupac was born in New York City to parents who were both political activists and Black Panther Party members. Raised by his mother, Afeni Shakur, 
                        he relocated to Baltimore in 1984 and to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1988. With the release of his debut album 2Pacalypse Now in 1991, 
                        he became a central figure in West Coast hip-hop for his conscious rap and political rap lyrics.[6][7] Amaru achieved further critical and commercial 
                        multi-platinum success with his follow-up albums Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z... (1993) and Me Against the World (1995).[8] His Diamond certified album 
                        All Eyez on Me (1996), the first double-length album in hip-hop history, abandoned his introspective lyrics for volatile gangsta rap.[9] In addition to his music career, 
                        Shakur starred roles in Juice (1992), Poetic Justice (1993), Above the Rim (1994), Bullet (1996), Gridlock'd (1997), and Gang Related (1997). 
                        Shakur's most notable songs include "California Love," "Changes," "Dear Mama," "Hail Mary," "Keep Ya Head Up," "Hit 'Em Up," "Ambitionz az a Ridah," 
                        "All Eyez on Me," "Ghetto Gospel," "Do for Love," "So Many Tears," "To Live & Die in L.A.," "How Do U Want It," "2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted," "Brenda's Got a Baby" and 
                        "I Get Around." Alongside his solo career, Shakur was part of the group Thug Life and collaborated with artists like Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, and Outlawz."

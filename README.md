# DeathRow_Mini_HackaThon
# Death Row Records - 90s Theme Website

This project was created for a mini hackathon at **Codedex** with a focus on a 90's theme. The idea was to capture the aesthetic, music, and cultural influence of the 90s, particularly through the lens of **Death Row Records**, a prominent music label during that era.

## Inspiration

When I think of the 90s, one of the first things that come to mind is the **influential rap culture** that took over American society. This era, while controversial, was deeply rooted in struggles faced by African Americans and served as a powerful vehicle for storytelling and self-expression. The music from labels like Death Row Records shaped modern music, fashion, and aesthetics, and continues to influence pop culture today.

This website attempts to honor that legacy, with respect to the struggles faced by the African American community during the time, as well as the creative power that was harnessed through music.

## Purpose

My goal for this project was to create a website that **feels nostalgic and amateurish**, in line with the rough-around-the-edges technology of the 90s. While the content is inspired by 90s rap and culture, I wanted the site to **reflect the raw energy** and **DIY spirit** of that time period. 

I chose to focus on **Death Row Records**, as the label was central to 90s rap, and encapsulated many of the themes in the music from that era. The site includes references to **Dr. Dre** and **Tupac Shakur**, two of the most iconic figures associated with the label. I also included a newsletter referencing the **Rodney King trials**, a significant event in American history during the 90s.

While I kept the language neutral and avoided explicit content, I acknowledge that discussing these topics might still evoke controversy. My intent was to honor the struggles and achievements of African Americans during this period, and recognize the power of music as a storytelling tool.

## Features

- **90s Aesthetic**: 
    - Retro grey scale color palette with black, white, and grey tones.
    - A heavy hitting 90s font that adds to the overall theme.
    - Simple, pixelated design elements reminiscent of 90s websites.
  
- **Spotify Embed**:
    - Embedded Spotify player for listening to music by **Dr. Dre** and **Tupac**.
    - The player was "retroified" by greyscaling and adding borders to maintain the 90s look.

- **Content**:
    - Short biographies of **Dr. Dre** and **Tupac Shakur**.
    - A newsletter about the **Rodney King trials**, providing historical context.
    - Simple links to articles about Death Row Records and its history.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: The structure and content of the website are built using basic HTML.
- **CSS**: The styling is done entirely with CSS to create a vintage, 90s feel.
  
## Challenges and Future Goals

Due to time constraints, the website currently includes just two iconic members of Death Row Records: **Dr. Dre** and **Tupac Shakur**. In the future, I would like to expand this website to include more members of the label and perhaps add more interactive elements, such as music samples or a more extensive news section. 

The design aims to capture the essence of the **90s internet**, where websites were often simple, bold, and somewhat rough around the edges.

## Installation

To run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the site.

## Conclusion

This website is a tribute to the **90s rap culture** and the music that shaped a generation. I hope it brings back memories for those who lived through that era, and introduces younger audiences to the impact that artists from **Death Row Records** had on the world.

Thank you for checking out this project!

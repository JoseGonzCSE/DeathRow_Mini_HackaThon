                    <h1>Andre Romell Young</h1>
                    <h2> Born: February 18, 1965 </h2>
                    <h2> Compton, CA</h2>
                    <p> "After a dispute with Eazy-E, Dre left the group at the peak of its popularity in 1991 under the advice of friend, and N.W.A lyricist, the D.O.C. and 
                        his bodyguard at the time, Suge Knight. Knight, a notorious strongman and intimidator, was able to have Eazy-E release Young from his contract and, 
                        using Dr. Dre as his flagship artist, founded Death Row Records. In 1992, Young released his first single, the title track to the film Deep Cover, a collaboration 
                        with rapper Snoop Dogg, whom he met through Warren G.[24] Dr. Dre's debut solo album was The Chronic, released under Death Row Records with Suge Knight as executive producer. 
                        Young ushered in a new style of rap, both in terms of musical style and lyrical content, including introducing a number of artists to the industry including 
                        Snoop Dogg, Kurupt, Daz Dillinger, RBX, the Lady of Rage, Nate Dogg and Jewell.

                        On the strength of singles such as "Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang", "Let Me Ride", and "Fuck wit Dre Day (and Everybody's Celebratin')" 
                        (known as "Dre Day" for radio and television play), all of which featured Snoop Dogg as guest vocalist, The Chronic became a cultural phenomenon, 
                        its G-funk sound dominating much of hip hop music for the early 1990s.[24] In 1993, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the album 
                        triple platinum,[28] and Dr. Dre also won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance for his performance on "Let Me Ride".[29] For that year, 
                        Billboard magazine also ranked Dr. Dre as the eighth-best-selling musical artist, The Chronic as the sixth-best-selling album, and "Nuthin' 
                        but a 'G' Thang" as the 11th-best-selling single.[30]"
